# Leveraging-Ensemble-Learning-with-BERT-and-GPT-2-for-Tweet-Classification-A-Deep-Learning-Approach
This project aims to enhance tweet classification accuracy by combining the strengths of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT-2 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2), two powerful deep learning models. Twitter's unique linguistic style presents challenges for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, making it an ideal testbed for our ensemble approach. By leveraging BERT's contextual understanding with GPT-2's generative language modeling, we propose a novel ensemble learning strategy to improve tweet categorization accuracy and robustness.
